# Perceptron Implementation

## Perceptron Introduction

The Perceptron is one of the fundamental building blocks of modern machine learning and artificial neural networks. It was developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. Inspired by the concept of a biological neuron, the Perceptron is a simple binary classifier that mimics decision-making processes. It played a significant role in the history of AI and machine learning, laying the foundation for more complex neural network architectures.

## Mathematical Principles

The Perceptron used in this code is based on rigorous mathematical principles. At its core, a Perceptron is a linear binary classifier. It takes a set of input features, multiplies them by corresponding weights, sums the results, and applies an activation function to make a binary decision.

### The Perceptron Model

In mathematical terms, the Perceptron model can be represented as:

```
y = activation(w_1 * x_1 + w_2 * x_2 + ... + w_n * x_n)
```

Where:
- `y` is the output (either -1 or 1 in our case, representing two classes).
- `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` are the input features.
- `w_1, w_2, ..., w_n` are the weights corresponding to the input features.
- `activation()` is the activation function (typically a step function).

The concept of linear separability is crucial here. If it's possible to find weights (`w_1, w_2, ..., w_n`) that can correctly classify the data points, we say that the data is linearly separable. This means there exists a hyperplane that can cleanly separate the data into different classes.

## Example

Let's illustrate the Perceptron with a simple example. Consider a binary classification problem with two features `(x1, x2)` and two classes `-1` and `1`. We have the following data points:

| Data Point | x1 | x2 | Class |
|------------|----|----|-------|
| Data 1     | 2  | 3  | 1     |
| Data 2     | 1  | 2  | 1     |
| Data 3     | 3  | 2  | -1    |
| Data 4     | 2  | 4  | -1    |

In this example, our Perceptron aims to find the weights `w_1` and `w_2` that correctly separate these data points into classes `1` and `-1`. The Perceptron will iteratively adjust its weights until a separation boundary is found.
